I'm currently a Computer Science graduate of the University of Virginia. In August 2020, I'll start work as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon. 
The purposes of creating this site are twofold:

- Create my own personal space on the internet
- Have a good ol' time with it

Currently, I am using the default [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/) theme for the design of the site, but I plan to hopefully tweak it to my liking at some point. Please get in touch with me if you have any questions or concerns about the website or anything posted here!
